Use a loop to ensure that an integer entered by the user at the keyboard is positive.
Use a second loop to count down from this integer in steps of 2, 
displaying each number on the screen until either 1 or 0 is reached, 
i.e. if the integer 16 (validated) is entered, the output would be:
16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0
and if 7 is entered, the output would be: 
7 5 3 1
